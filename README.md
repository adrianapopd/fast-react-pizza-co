# fast-react-pizza-co
My first React web application, using Components and Props. 
This is one of my projects following the Udemy "The ultimate React Course 2024" by Jonas Schmedtmann. I was amazed by all changes that React brings into web development area, like reusing Components. I discovered my love for React when I realised it is possible to update automatically the UI Components on data/ state change! ü§ç
